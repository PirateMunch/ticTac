tic tac toe game project
-Main Brief for project-
My main brief is to use Modules and Factories and keep the code tidy. all logic should fit in 3 objects -  Player, GameBoard and DisplayController (using module, factory and IIFE) - and kept out of global scope.

-Progress & Lessons/Skills learnt-
My biggest lesson beyond scope and closure so far, is KISS and DRY! About 30hours in, I had almost completed the task, but due to over complicating my code and project my logic was not organised and I think I got stuck in a logic box, player turn count was 5scopes deep in a function for gamePlay (my player turn logic  was refreshed each turn resulting in random play).  2days of learning lexical scope and closure and looking at my logic, I decided it was time to start again! Following KISS + DRY principle's.

this time I got the basic game function working with basic UI in the global scope. Then wrapped the game up in an IIFE module to isolate it before working on import user Player info and Display. Then built the UI up from there (as described in TOP brief! got to stop overthinking and building away from the brief, CSS tricks can wait untill the logic works!)
